    <h1>Subtraction</h1>
<p><Subtraction is an important tool we use to help us find out 
  what is left when taking one number away from another. For example 
  if Lauren has $23 and spends $12 on a new shirt,
   we can use subtraction to find out how much money Lauren has left.
    To set up this problem, we place the two numbers vertically, 
    with the bigger number on top of the smaller number:
    It's important that the place values line up. 
    The ones should be in the same column, the tens
     should be in the same column, and so on. Also, 
     when writing subtraction problems, remember to
      add the subtraction sign to the left of the numbers. 
      Once the numbers are lined up correctly, solve the problem 
      by subtracting the bottom number from the top number 
      in each column to get the answer of $11. Lauren has $11 left
       to spend./p>
