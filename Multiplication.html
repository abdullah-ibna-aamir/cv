    <h1>How to Multiply</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>By Abdullah</p>
    <p>Multiplication is basically repeated addition. for example, 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20 Also 5 x 4 = 20 Anoter example, 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 36 Also 6 x 6 = 36 Imagine you have to do 8 multiplied with 13 instead of writing 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8
        + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 =104 You can just write 8 x 13 = 104. it is just basically a short version of addition.
